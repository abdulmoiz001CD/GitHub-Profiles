Hey GitHub community! 👋

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: a simple yet powerful web application that lets you search for GitHub profiles in an instant. 🚀

Key Features:
🔍 Search by Username: Just type in the GitHub username and hit 'Search' to find profiles.
💼 Profile Details: View essential information such as the user's name, bio, followers, following, and public repositories.
🔗 Direct Links: Quickly access profiles with a direct link to their GitHub page.

Tech Stack:

Bootstrap 5
JavaScript (Fetch API)
How It Works:
Enter GitHub Username: Type the username in the search bar.
Hit Search: Click the search button to fetch the profile data.
View Profile: Profile details are displayed in a neat card format.
